        <h1 id="headline">Welcome to our Monochromatic Website</h1>
        <p>This is a simple website just to show what it will look like to have a <span>admin page</span>
        first we need a login page but how do we go to it? there are a couple of way to hide it but one way i like is using keyboard keys if you press the keys (a+d+k) it should open the login page
        <br>
        Why do we need an admin page, you ask? Well, it's where the magic happens! With it, we can manage, organize, and sprinkle a little digital stardust across our website.
